    <h3><strong>Terrestrial Planets</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Venus</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
        <li>Mars</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><p>These kinds of planes are mainly made primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within our solar system, they are the four planets close to the sun. some people actually consider Earth's mood the be part of the tertiary family. These forms of planets are more likely to have life on them than the gas planets, it's more likely that when these kinds of planes appear with <strong> Goldilocks zone</strong>, they have a higher probability of having life. </p></h4>

    <h5><strong>Gas Planets</strong></h5>
    <br>
    <Ol>
        <li>Jupiter</li>
        <li>Saturn</li>
        <li>Uranus</li>
        <li>Neptune</li>
    </Ol>

    <h6><p>Also known as the gas giants are some of the bigger planets within our solar system but happen to be one of the lighter in weight, due to the fact that their body is made of different gas and chemical fusions. These planes are less likely to hold life, but their many moons are not off the hook. Some Astrophysicists theorise that Jupiterâ€™s moon Titan might be sustainable for life. All these planets themselves have <strong>rings</strong>, they may not be as forward as those of Saturn but they are there, still puzzling for some astronomers.</p></h6>
